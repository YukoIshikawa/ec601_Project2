# User stories 

## Background:   
Twitter supports mainly three types of responses to a tweet, click the like icon, retweet (including quote retweet), and reply. 
The twitter Likes represent agreement or appreciation for a tweet in general, while retweet especially quote retweet and reply contain both positive and negative responses and do not necessarily mean endorsements. Hence, it is not easy at first glance to determine whether a tweet is retweeted or replied with positive intention or negative intentions.  
People who got a lot of responses to a tweet want to know how people feel and respond to the tweet. Furthermore, people want to evaluate whether the tweet has a positive, negative, or neutral influence. Therefore, it is important to analyze the sentiment of quote retweets and replies to the tweet, determine how people respond and analyze how it influences people.
